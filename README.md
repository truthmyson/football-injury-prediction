INJURY PREDITION MODEL

this model has been trained to predict the likelihood on a football play attaining injury in the next coming season.
I leveraged the k-nearest neighbour model with scoring rate after making predictin on the test data to be 0.93 .
I also saved the model for later use. Such as integrate it into an application.
